  Businesses, especially large ones, can afford to provide security infrastructure that lets them provide
  secure access to their digital services. For small businesses and non-professional uses however, while
  still possible to do, it can be daunting. This article examines the various options open to people who
  may wish to provide secure access to services at minimal cost and complexity.

In this article (which I will likely update from time-to-time), I will cover the following remote service access tools:

* Cloud services
  * Cloudflare Zero Trust
  * Tailscale
  * NGROK
  * Zerotier
  * Twingate
  * Holesail
* On-premise services
  * Virtual Private Networks (VPN's)
  * Proxy/Security services

Please [let me know](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/newblog/issues) if there is another service you think should be covered here.

## Cloud services

These are services run by 3rd-party vendors that you configure for your own use. The important thing to remember is that you MUST trust the vendor because they are acting as a man-in-the-middle between your Internet-connected users and your private services.

Also note that these are not VPN's in any traditional sense. They all use a small server service that runs in your local network that facilitates access. As such, they also do not require local firewall changes. This makes them typically much easier to set up than on-premise services.

### Cloudflare Zero Trust/Cloudflare Access

[Website](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/zero-trust/), [Documentation](https://www.twingate.com/docs/).

For what it is worth, this is the service I use personally.

Cloudflare Zero Trust is a full edge-security solution that includes a number of components: Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Secure Web Gateway (SWG), Firewall as a Service, WAN as a Service.

This product is significantly more comprehensive than the other products mentioned here. However, it can also be a little more complex to set up. But it provides a comprehensive, integrated edge security service for connecting private networks/apps to the Internet.

Not all of the components need to be configured in order to implement remote service access, mostly just the ZTNA and SWG. Without configuration, many of the other features have sensible defaults so you still benefit from CF's extensive threat management.

Free tier:
* Up to 50 users. External authentication providers available.
* No limit on networks, endpoints or apps protected.
* Non-web support for SSH, VNC, RDP, TCP and UDP traffic.
* ZTNA, SWG.
* Limited CASB (2 read-only API integrations) and data loss protection (pre-defined policies).
* Access control using groups, geolocation, device posture, session duration, external API's, etc.
* Clientless (browser) access to web apps, SSH and VNC.
* Split tunnelling.
* Token authentication for services.
* Internal DNS support for local service access.
* Threat protection: filtering, AV inspection, threat intelligence, IP6 support, SSH proxy, network-level physical location policies (up to 3).
* Upload/download controls.
* Global interconnects (Cloudflare has one of the largest global networks).
* Full DNS integration - especially when using CF for DNS.
* CF Shared external TLS certificates.
* [And a lot more](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/plans/zero-trust-services/).

####

* [Cloudflare WARP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/) cross-platform client enables corporate *devices* to be interconnected securely (similar to Tailscale?) but still benefits from all of the other Zero Trust features. As it is included in ZTNA, it is available on the free tier.
* [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) (`cloudflared` cross-platform app) is the feature that allows private endpoints to be accessed from the Internet without needing complex local firewall rules or exposure of private networks.
* [Identity Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/) can be via an external identity provider (e.g. GitHub, Google, Microsoft, etc. or your own IdM supporting OIDC/OAuth or SAML), a one-time pin (OTP) or a combination. *Note that CF ZT does not have its own user identity store*. When a user accesses a resource, they are authenticated against the external provider and consume one "seat" (50 seats available in the free tier). It is possible to set expiration periods on seats (1 month up to 1 year) so that occasional users do not consume all seats. So it is possible to have >50 users as long as they are only occasionally accessing your services. Documentation for 20+ public IdMs is provided. Note that some cloud IdM's have free tiers, social logins are mostly free.

Paid tiers: Pay-as-you-go US$7 per user per month. Contract plans.

Identity Providers with free tiers: [Auth0](https://auth0.com) (25k monthly active users, supports passkeys)

### Tailscale

[Website](https://tailscale.com), [Documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install).

Node-RED contributor Bart Butenaers has [a good write-up of using Tailscale with Node-RED](https://discourse.nodered.org/t/tailscale/92474/21).

Free tier:
* 3 users only.
* 100 devices only.
* "nearly all of Tailscale's features"

[Paid plans](https://tailscale.com/pricing): US$5 per month Personal+ (6 users), $6 per user per month Starter, $18pu/pm Premium, Enterprise.

Like Cloudflare Zero Trust, Tailscale does not handle user identities directly, you use an external identity provider.

### NGROK

[Website](https://ngrok.com), [Documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs).

> [!Quote]
> Your appâ€™s front door.
> All-in-one API gateway, Kubernetes Ingress, DDoS protection, firewall, and global load balancing as a service.

Free tier is easy to set up but is really only suitable for testing and development.

Free tier:
* HTTP only.
* Ephemeral/random domain names for testing.
* Automated TLS certificates.
* OAuth support.
* Request inspection and replay.
* Email support only.
* No custom domain.

[Paid Plans](https://ngrok.com/pricing): 

### Zerotier

[Website](https://www.zerotier.com), [Documentation](https://docs.zerotier.com/).

### Holesail

[Website](https://holesail.io)

Free, open source.

## On-premise services

On-premise services are applications you run on your own site and infrastructure as opposed to running in a vendor cloud platform.

### Virtual Private Networks

VPN's connect two or more **_TRUSTED_** networks together into a single network. It is considered "virtual" because the VPN is overlayed on one or more **_UNTRUSTED_** network (typically the Internet).

The critical thing to remember about VPN's is that the whole network can only ever be as secure as the **_WEAKEST_** link.

For example, if you extend your VPN to a laptop and that laptop is left exposed somewhere or is compromised by malware, _your whole network is potentially exposed_.

For this reason I strongly advise avoiding VPN's unless you really know what you are doing and have the resources to properly configure and maintain both the network and _all_ of the devices connected to it.

### Proxy and security services

TBC

#### Headscale/Ionscale

These are on-premise versions of the Tailscale cloud service.
