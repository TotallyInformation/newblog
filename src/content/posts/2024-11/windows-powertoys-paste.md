Microsoft's PowerToys for Windows is a handy set of utilities that is always one of the first things that I install when I get a new PC.

It includes the ["Advanced Paste" utility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/powertoys/advanced-paste).

> A tool that enables you to paste the content from your clipboard into any format needed. It can paste as plain text, markdown, JSON, .txt file, .html file, or .png file directly with the UX or with a direct keystroke invoke. It can also extract and paste the text directly from an image in your clipboard.

It took me a while to work out just how useful this is - useful enough to make me memorise the keyboard shortcut! ðŸ˜Š <kbd>win</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>v</kbd>.

So here are my 3 favourite things about advanced paste. There are other features as well.

## Manages copy/clipboard history

Enables the clipboard to keep a history of copies. This can be really helpful when grabbing a bunch of information quickly. Rather than having to labouriously be in one app, copy, switch to another app, paste. Rinse and repeat. Now you can just keep copying then switch once and paste from the history.

## Paste in different formats

Possibly the most important feature.

You can paste text as html, markdown or plain text. You can also paste to file both in Windows Explorer and in VSCode.

Similarly, images can be pasted to a png file or the text can be extracted.

## Extract text from copied images

While Microsoft OneNote and a few other apps can do this, the integration with the clipboard makes it super easy.
