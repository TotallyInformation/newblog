    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>
        This is my latest website and blog. This is about my 5th website since the early days of the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        This version will take over from my previous blog site at <a href="https://it.knightnet.org.uk">Much Ado About IT</a> which
        simply became too complex and messy to easily maintain after being migrated from an original DIY content mangement system to
        Blogsite and then on to Wordpress, then a brief encounter with Jekyll - yeuk! - and finally on to Hugo/Netlify.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this itteration, I'm using <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro</a> hosted on <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Cloudflare Pages</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once again returning to a mostly DIY site and using the styling taken from my work on <a>UIBUILDER for Node-RED</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>About TotallyInformation</h2>
    <p>
        TotallyInformation is a trading name that I've been using since around 2012 when I was toying with the idea that I might
        wish to move out of the Enterprise IT world into less stressfull and more local IT. That never happened but I used the
        TotallyInformation name mostly for my work on Open Source projects and other GitHub repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
        TotallyInformation is the trading name for Julian Knight. I am based in Sheffield, UK.
    </p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        By day, I work as an Enterprise Architect, currently for the NHS. These days mostly working on assuring and governing large
        Digital and Technology programmes and projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of that work, amongst family committments and other activities, I mostly contribute to the Node-RED low-code application.
        My main contribution being <a href="https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-uibuilder" target="_blank">node-red-contrib-uibuilder</a>, a extension to Node-RED that facilitiates the building and management
        of data-driven websites and apps.
    </p>
